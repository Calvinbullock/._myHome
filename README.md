## my_nvim
My neo vim config

My litle trip into trying neo vim as my main code edditer.

My starting point was:

- The 0 to LSP : Neovim RC From Scratch - by the ThePrimeagen
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7i4amO_zaE&t=9s
- Effective Neovim: Instant IDE - by TJ DeVries
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stqUbv-5u2s
- NeoVim for noobs
https://github.com/cpow/neovim-for-newbs/tree/main

#### Nvim notes
everything under lua dir is from neovim for noobs and not curently in use.


## BashRC

This is a folder containg files that extend my .bashrc.

#### Prompt_bash:
This is where my custom bash prompt lives. It is based off of my-extravagant-zsh-prompt
after the redditer user linked below modifyed it for bash. I have made a lot of customizations
to fit my needs and likes.

Taken from a reddit post that forked it from stevelosh.
