My neo vim config

My litle trip into trying neo vim as my main code edditer.

My starting point was

The 0 to LSP : Neovim RC From Scratch - by the ThePrimeagen

and 

Effective Neovim: Instant IDE - by TJ DeVries
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stqUbv-5u2s

and 

NeoVim for noobs
https://github.com/cpow/neovim-for-newbs/tree/main

# notes
everything under lua dir is from neovim for noobs and not curently in use.
