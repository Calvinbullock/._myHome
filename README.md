# Overview

    This is a folder containg files that extend my .bashrc.

# Prompt:
This is where my custome bash prompt lives. It is heavely based off of my-extravagant-zsh-prompt 
after the redditer user linked below modifyed it for bash. I have made a few customizations for
it to fit my needs and likes.

Taken from a reddit post that forked it from stevelosh.
